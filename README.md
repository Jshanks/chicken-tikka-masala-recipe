This is one of my favorite dishes, and a lot of people who eat this tell me it's one of their favorite meals as well. They often ask for the recipe, so I decided to open source it. This will probably evolve over time as I improve and experiment with it. Enjoy!

## Instructions ‚ÑπÔ∏è

### The chicken (Chicken Tikka) üêî

- Put the chicken in a bowl with all of the ingredients of the chicken marinade, stir everything together well and let it sit for anywhere from 30¬†minutes to a 24 hours.

- When ready to cook: pre-heat a cast iron skillet in the oven under the broiler, and cook the chicken thighs under the broiler once the pan is hot. ~15-20 minutes.
* alternatively, just put on a baking sheet under the broiler and flip the chicken over to get color on both sides.

### The gravy (Masala) ü•£

- In a large and tall cooking pot, melt the butter\heat up the oil and fry the onions until they develop some color while stirring occasionally.

- Add ginger, garlic, and tomato paste and let cook for just about 30 seconds while continuing to stir. 

- Add¬†chicken tikka masala seasoning, kashmiri chili powder, salt, tomatoes with the liquid, brown sugar and methi leaves. Let this simmer for a bit - 20-30 minutes.

- Add ingredients from the pot into a blender, blending until everything is pretty well incorporated.

- add the gravy back to the pot, and let simmer a bit longer if you so choose (30-90 minutes).

- Add the heavy cream or half & half, stirring everything in.

- Finally, add the chicken and let it simmer for 5 - 10 minutes. From here, check the consistency¬†and decide to your taste to add more cream.

Serve with rice, naan, or roti. üöÄ
